  "synopsis": {
    "title": "About the film",
    "intro": "HUNGER explores emotional emptiness, trauma, and human hunger — both internal and physical, metaphorical and literal.",
    "content": "The characters are caught between the luxury of the external world and the chaos of their inner world. The film is about the introspective perception of reality, about how people react to their past traumas and the desire for control or escape from past events.",

    "title": "Vision",
    "narrative": {
      "title": "Structure and narration",
      "content": "A non-linear narrative with flashbacks showing parallel or contrasting events — psychological truth, not linear history. Repeated motifs of pool scenes, refrigerator, kitchen, and drinks emphasize the obsessive need for control and symbolic hunger."
    },
    "sound": {
      "title": "Silence and music",
      "content": "Music is external, often in contrast with the silence of interior spaces. Silence symbolizes introspective emptiness, while external music represents the illusory glamour of the world."
    },
    "essence": "HUNGER is a film about wounds of the soul and love that ultimately restores the masculine and feminine principle. Dangerous and uncomfortable. An intelligent film."
